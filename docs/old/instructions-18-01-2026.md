## Task

Today, we are testing the circles pipeline and the frontend. In this case, I'll need to be able to do the following by the end:

1. Research on users who can go inside the circle. In Deburn-Front-End, I should be able to do the following:

- Assign a Group admin. What database is obtained here to do the group admin? How is a user defined as a group admin?
- In the group admin, I want to be able to send out invitations.
- I also want to see some calendar stuff.
- I also want you to refer to the backend logic and frontend logic for the circles part to see how it works.

## Do's and Dont's

- Do: Stick to the necessary files in the backend unless instructed to go to the frontend.
- Do: Create a log using today's date and write down everything you did.
- Don't: Start coding anything without my signal.
- Do: Always adhere to SOLID Principles.
