## Registration Fix - Duplicate Email Check

Fixed registration flow where users could create orphaned Firebase accounts when email already existed in MongoDB.

**Problem:**
- Registration checked `firebaseUid` in MongoDB but not `email`
- If email existed (unique index), Firebase user was created first, then MongoDB insert failed
- Result: orphaned Firebase users with no corresponding MongoDB record

**Solution:**
- Added email check in MongoDB BEFORE creating Firebase user
- If email exists, return error immediately without touching Firebase

**Files Changed:**
- `app_v2/routers/auth.py` - Added `get_user_by_email()` check before Firebase creation

**Debug Print Statements Added:**
- `[REGISTER] Starting registration for email: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Checking if email exists in MongoDB: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Email already exists in MongoDB: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Creating Firebase user: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Firebase user created with UID: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Creating user in MongoDB: ...`
- `[REGISTER] MongoDB user created with ID: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Creating default preferences for user: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Sending verification email to: ...`
- `[REGISTER] Registration complete for: ...`

## Email Branding - Environment Variables

Updated email service to use environment variables for branding, replacing hardcoded "Deburn" references.

**New Environment Variables:**
- `SMTP_FROM_NAME` - Sender display name (default: "Human First AI")
- `EMAIL_TEAM_NAME` - Team name for email signatures (default: "The Human First AI Team")

**Files Changed:**
- `.env` - Updated `SMTP_FROM_NAME`, added `EMAIL_TEAM_NAME`
- `app_v2/services/email/email_service.py`:
  - Added `team_name` parameter with env var support
  - Updated default `from_name` from "Deburn" to "Human First AI"
  - Updated all email templates to use `{self._team_name}`:
    - Verification email (HTML + text)
    - Circle invitation email (HTML + text)
    - Password reset email (HTML + text)

## Coach Daily Limit Reset

Reset daily exchange count for all users to allow continued testing.

**Command Used:**
```python
await db.users.update_many({}, {"$set": {"coachExchanges.dailyCount": 0}})
```

**Result:** Reset for 21 users

## Check-in Insight Persistence

Added persistence for AI-generated check-in insights so they show up on the dashboard.

**Problem:**
- When a user submitted a check-in, an AI-generated insight and tip were returned in the response
- These insights were only displayed on the check-in completion screen
- If the user navigated away or logged in later, the insight was lost
- The dashboard showed "X insights waiting" but check-in insights weren't being counted

**Solution:**
- When a check-in is submitted, the generated insight is now saved to the `insights` collection
- The insight has a 24-hour expiration (relevant for today only)
- Duplicate prevention: If user retakes check-in on the same day, a new insight is NOT created
- The persisted insight now counts towards `insightsCount` on the dashboard

**Files Changed:**
- `app_v2/pipelines/checkin.py`:
  - Added `InsightService` import
  - Added `insight_service` parameter to `submit_checkin_pipeline()`
  - Added logic to persist insight to `insights` collection
  - Added duplicate check using `has_recent_insight()` with 1-day window
- `app_v2/routers/checkin.py`:
  - Added `get_insight_service` dependency
  - Added `InsightService` import
  - Updated `submit_checkin` endpoint to inject and pass `insight_service`

**Insight Document Created:**
```python
{
    "userId": ObjectId,
    "type": "checkin",
    "trigger": "daily_checkin",
    "title": "Today's Check-in Insight",
    "description": "<insight>\n\nTip: <tip>",
    "metrics": {"mood": int, "stress": int, "sleep": int},
    "isRead": False,
    "expiresAt": datetime (24 hours from now),
    "createdAt": datetime
}
```

## Check-in Insight Update on Retake

Changed check-in insight behavior from skip-on-duplicate to update-on-retake.

**Previous Behavior:**
- If user retook check-in on same day, the existing insight was kept (no new insight created)
- User would see the same old insight even after retaking with different metrics

**New Behavior:**
- Same-day retake: Update existing insight with new AI-generated content
- Different day: Create new insight (previous day's insight expires via 24h TTL)
- On update, `isRead` is reset to `false` so user sees the new insight

**Files Changed:**
- `app_v2/services/progress/insight_service.py`:
  - Added `update_or_create_checkin_insight()` method
  - Finds existing insight created today (using start-of-day comparison)
  - If found: updates title, description, metrics, expiresAt, resets isRead
  - If not found: creates new insight document
- `app_v2/pipelines/checkin.py`:
  - Removed `has_recent_insight()` check and skip logic
  - Now calls `update_or_create_checkin_insight()` directly
  - Added all 5 metrics (mood, physicalEnergy, mentalEnergy, sleep, stress)

**Insight Document Structure:**
```python
{
    "userId": ObjectId,
    "type": "checkin",
    "trigger": "daily_checkin",
    "title": "Today's Check-in Insight",
    "description": "<insight>\n\nTip: <tip>",
    "metrics": {
        "mood": int,
        "physicalEnergy": int,
        "mentalEnergy": int,
        "sleep": int,
        "stress": int
    },
    "isRead": False,
    "expiresAt": datetime (24 hours from now),
    "createdAt": datetime,
    "updatedAt": datetime
}
```

**Recommended Index:**
```javascript
db.insights.createIndex(
  { "userId": 1, "trigger": 1, "createdAt": -1 },
  { name: "user_trigger_date" }
)
```
